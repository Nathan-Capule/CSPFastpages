Many people were interested in our groups chess project which was actually surprising to me. We had some issues with the api but people were still able to play a game of chess. I enjoyed showing off the frontend code that me as well as Toby Leeder spent countless hours on.</p>

<p>Other People’s Art:
I went to the ceramics building and saw Aiden Leeder’s art project, which were two ceramic items.I liked how he was creative in his design choice which really helped his project to stick out from the crowd.</p>
