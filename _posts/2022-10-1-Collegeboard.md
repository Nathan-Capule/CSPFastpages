1.1: Collaboration
CRD - 1.A.1: A computing innovation includes a program as a part of its function.
CRD - 1.A.2: Innovation can be physical, nonphysical, or a nonphysical computing concept.
CRD - 1.A.3: Collaboration leads to computing innovations which show aspects of all members strengths.
CRD - 1.A.4: Collaboration needs different perspectives
Collaboration allows for different perspectives
Benefits of collaborating with peers: answer is B, promotes diversity  and shows different perspectives as well as talents.
Pair Programming: Driver types code, observer just watches, only helping when necessary.
Leave comments in code to help others

1.2: Program Function and Purpose
CRD-2.A.1: Computing innovations are used to solve problems
CRD-2.A.2: Knowing the purpose for innovations can help programmers.
For example, the computing innovation of social media is to help people keep in touch.
Another example is that a digital assistant device leads to more convenient use of technology.
CRD-2.C.1: Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing.
CRD-2.C.2: An event is associated with an action.
CRD-2.C.3: Events can be generated when a key is pressed.
CRD-2.C.4: Inputs usually affect the output.
CRD-2.C.5: Event-triggered program has events occur when triggered.
CRD-2.C.6: Input can come from user or other programs.
CRD-2.D.1: Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device.
CRD-2.D.2: Program output is usually based on program's prior input,
Many different forms of input from sound to clicks.
Input usually affects the output.
Action triggers event, could be initiated by the user. Jumps to the specific code segment.
CRD-2.B.1: A program is a collection of program statements.
CRD-2.B.2: Code segment is a part of a whole.
CRD-2.B.3: A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations.
Program is oftentimes referred to as software.

Programmers need to think about the user when creating a program.
Programmer can survey potential users.
Programmers need to do A LOT of testing
Programs usually developed by teams, with even thousands of people
Each member deserves credit
Documentation is important to keep track of progress.
Commenting is also important
Comments in python are #, comments in Java Script can be // or /* or /**
Describe purpose of code and document a lot.
