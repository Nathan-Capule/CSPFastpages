# Collegeboard MCQ Test # 4
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/test4.png "45/50")
I got a 45/50 on the Collegeboard MCQ Test#4 which is a 90%. I am pretty proud of this score because I thought that I would have gotten a lower score. From this test I realized that coding is very intuitive. Such as the fact that lossLESS does not lose data while lossy does. Also that a lot of collegeboards questions for CSP can be answered without any coding knowledge, just with logic, which is what coding is in my opinion.

# Questions that I missed

## Question 28

I chose option A because I thought that if you go from 32 bit to 64 bit in binary it means 32 options to 64 so double. But it means that there are 64 binary digits instead of 32 so actually 2^32 more options so C.

## Question 32

I thought that you were initializing the current score therefore it would not change at an instant. but instead it meant that it will show the score at any time. This means that since it can change then you cannot use it therefore it is only I and III so the answer is B.

## Question 36
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Q36.png "Question 36")
I thought that A was the answer because it would be easy to run but I missed the part where it said "a heuristic" which is not necessary of question 36. Instead the answer is B as you need it for factorials.

## Question 41
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Q41.png "Question 41")
For this question I misunderstood the fact that it will just return the amount of negatives for B. Instead, finding the column for each negative would be more useful. This means that the answer has to be C.

## Question 49
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Q49.png "Question 49")
This question I did not realize that B did not even ask for the students score, now seeing this the answer became much more clear, A.

# What I learned
I learned about the importance of using common sense. The MCQ is mostly just common sense, if I focused on reading the questions instead of speeding through it I could have gotten a better score.
