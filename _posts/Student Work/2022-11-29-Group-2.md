## Notes

### What is an Algorithm
* Sequencing: Algorithms do tasks in order
* Selection: Helps to choose an outcome
* Iteration: Code repeats if true
* Algorithms can be shown in two ways. 
    * In flowcharts which uses shapes and arrows
    *  In Pseudocode where there is human language and coding format.

### Order of Operations

* Operations in parentheses are done first
* Division and multiplication before addition and subtraction
* Modules works similar to multiplication and division
