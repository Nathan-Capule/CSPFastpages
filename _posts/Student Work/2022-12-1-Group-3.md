## Notes
### Boolean
* Represents logical propositions
* Either true or false, such as testing for two numbers being equal
* Represented with variables

### Logical Operators
* Not displays the opposite
* And is used for two conditions together
* Or is when using the function to see if one condition is met

### Nested Conditional
* Output changes based on what is written
* Nested conditional statements have a coditional statement inside of another conditional statement.
* TCalled nested conditional because they are nested together,
* Can be used for varying "else if statement"

## Hacks
### 3.5
* Explain in your own words what each logical operator does
*   Not statement will display based on if the result is the opposite of the data. 
*   And Statement will display only if both of the conditions within the code are met.
*   Or statements will display if at least one of the conditionals within the code are met.
* Code your own scenario that makes sense for each logical operator
