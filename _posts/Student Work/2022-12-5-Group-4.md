## Notes
* An iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm that repeats until a condition is met.
* An iteration statement changes the flow of control until a condition allows it to stop
* "Repeat until" does exactly what it says, it repeats until the condition is false.
### 3.8.1
* Stopping conditions are oftentimes necessary within an iteration.
* While statements help to complete an action until a condition becomes false, for example we can print hello while i is less than 6, but once it becomes more than 6 it stops.
* An iteration is a part of an algorithm and stopping conditions help to stop an iteration.
### 3.8.2
* An iteration statement causes statements to be executed 0 or more times
* Range functions can help to restrict what is printed, starting from 0 and going until the number before the ranges number.
* If you want to restrict the lower bound to not be 0 you can print from (x,y)
* While loops allow variation as well but can be formatted differently.

### 3.8.3
* "for loops" will complete the function within the for loop until the condition  given is no longer met.
* The purpose of this code is to simplify code making it easier to create long strings of code.

### 3.10.1
* List expressions use list indexing and list procedures
* List procedures are implemented in accordance with the syntax rules of the language used
* AP exam will use pseudocode for loops
### 3.10.2
* Traversing a list visits each element in order which can help to identify an element within a list.
* A given element of a list can ve evaluated using "[ ]"

## Hacks
### 3.8.1
* 1: Define an iteration
    * An iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm that repeats until a condition is met.
* 2: Make an example of an iteration
    * Lets say that I am looking for the plane that I need to board, starting with 1 and going to 10.
    * I can start searching at gate 1 for the plane that I need to board
    * Each time I increase the gate number by 1 until I find the plane that I need to board
    * Then I stop using a break function or in this case, just stopping and getting on the plane.
* 3: Program a simple iteration

### 3.8.2
* 1: What is an iteration statement
    * An iteration is a part of an algorithm that repeats until a condition is met.
* 2: Create a descending list of numbers using for loop
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/descending1.png "descending numbers")
* Using while loop, make a list of numbers which will form an output of 3,16,29,42,55,68,81
