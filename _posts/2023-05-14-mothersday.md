### Dear Mom,

time for me to write the best letter out of the family (again). although today is supposed to be your day, i think that as well as celebrating you, we should remember all the things that you have done for us. from writing daily lunch notes, to delivering homework for us whenever we inevitably forget. you have always been one step ahead when it comes to motherhood, and we never say thank you. we have come to expect a standard of care from you, something that should be treated as a luxury and not a right. there are millions of children who would be lucky to have a mother half as good as you are. i know that every year, each child tells their mom that they are the best, but i legitimately believe that if this were a game, you beat it. if this was a task, you completed it, if this was an olympic event, you wouldn't just medal, you would be the michael phelps of the sport. i think i speak for the family when i say that we don't thank you enough, so thank you mom, we love you and happy mother's day.

### Love, Nathan

#### PS: I had the best letter, right?
