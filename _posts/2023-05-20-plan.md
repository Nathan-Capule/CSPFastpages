### My Plan

I am going to add an animation for a sprite, in which the sprite will move a couple inches each time the person gets a correct answer.

Update: I was able to kind of create an animation, in which I used a youtube tutorial by Franks Laboratory to create a mushroom that walks from right to left. Now, I just need to make the animation only go a part of the screen, save the new location, and continue from there whenever I answer a new question, shouldn't be too bad... I hope.
