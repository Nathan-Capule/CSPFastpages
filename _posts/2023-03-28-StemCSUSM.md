# Reflection
I am currently a junior at Del Norte, and I have not really thought about my major. I have around 6 months to get my college applications done and I have barley started. This meeting was a wake up call for me, I learned about the college life and how to succeed in college from two students who are very different from the average Del Norte student. i think that this was a calming experience as it kind of gave me a warmth knowing what to expect. Thank you for this opprotunity, also the circuit building was fun.
