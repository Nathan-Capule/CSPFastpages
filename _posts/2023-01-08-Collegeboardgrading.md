## My Score 47/50
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Score.png "47/50")

### Question 24
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/24.png "24")
The function repeats why 3 times meaning it is basically adding y 3 times so 3y therefore the correct answer is B.

### Question 30
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/30.png "30")
I misread the function which shifted my answer.

### Question 50
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/500.png "50")
Hexadecimal would shift it by 16 not ten so it would end up at V.
