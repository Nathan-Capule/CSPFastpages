<li>Simulation: Imitation of a process, kinda of like an experiment in your computer.</li>
<li>Example of a simulation is games as it is just testing and running code technically.</li>
<li>Try to think of why a simulation would be helpful, this will allow you to see if a simulation is even necessary.</li>
<li>Advantages of simulations<ul>
<li>Safer</li>
<li>cost effective</li>
<li>efficient</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages<ul>
<li>Not as accurate</li>
<li>Data could be changing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Real life example: Four corners</li>
<li>For the four corners, there are many different outside variables that could change the outcome, such as Mr.Mortenson being able to hear people move, or maybe him even peeking and looking to see which number people choose.</li>
<li>Dice is an example of a good simulation as rolling a die could be done much more efficiently within a simulation.</li>

<li>Create an idea for a simulation and describe it (you donâ€™t actually have to code it just think about/answer the guiding questions).<ul>
<li>One idea for a simulation is an engine testing simulation for airplanes. The simulation will run flights through different weather conditions where each weather condition having a different chance at causing a malfunction in the engine. The simulation will run until the engine fails and then print how many flights the engine lasted. This would allow mechanics to easily test different builds and allow them to make small changes without having to wait until a plane in real life fails.</li>

<h3 id="Hack-#3">Hack #3<a class="anchor-link" href="#Hack-#3"> </a></h3><ul>
<li>Describe the rolling dice simulation (answer guiding questions)<ul>
<li>The rolling dice simulation chooses a random number from 1-6 which simulates the possible outcomes from rolling a standard 6 sided die. This is an example to a simulation as it imitates the process of rolling a die. The advantages is that this is purely random, not changed by small imperfections within one side of the die. A disadvantage is that it is not perfectly related to a die in the real world as it is actually random. I think that an experiment would be better as it would give more accurate results.
### Hack #4</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add a feature onto the rolling dice simulation above <ul>
<li>ex: a 14-sided dice or expand the purpose of the simulation (hint: use conditionals to make dice part of a game/real life situation)
I changed it so that you can roll a 13-sided die and roll up to 13 times. I also added different if-statements depending on the sum of the results.</li>

An advantage to this is it is actually random and you will see real "random" results, but a disadvantage to this is that it is not realistic at all.
