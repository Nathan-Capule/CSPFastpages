title: The Quiz I Made Online
---

[Here](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/WjBs8rx6hPSf7RR8yhkKBi9ibSjqiJpCf5Ico8hb2pA) is a link to the quiz that I made, there are a couple of bugs.

To create my quiz I used a lot of "on events". The way it works is that when the object is clicked, it sets a new screen. I am also currently trying to implement a movement button as well as a collision detector. This is so that when two objects touch it can display a new screen. I enjoyed working on this quiz and I am sure that I will come back in the future to tweak it once I learn more.

Quiz Planning: I decided to make a quiz about my friends as well as the members of my group

Trial and Error: I tried using buttons to move an image and it worked but I was not able to create a collision detection.
