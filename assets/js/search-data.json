            "title": "Lab #1_ Measurements And Graphical Analysis",
            "content": "By: Nathan Capule . Purpose Statement (s): Given “disks” of different radii, determine the relationship between the mass and radius of the disks through graphical method. In using graphical method, we will learn about linearization and the use of it to create a mathematical model. . 1. Write a brief outline of the procedure you will use to collect data. What data . would you need to collect? . I will fold the disk until I can clearly see the thickness on the ruler, then I would divide the thickness of the folded disk by the amount of times I folded the disk. This would help me get the thickness of the disks, for the radius I will fold the disk in half and measure the length of the semicircle created, then I will decide that length by 2 to get the radii. Finally, I would place each disk on a scale to find the mass in grams. . 2. Answer these Qs right after your procedure. What is the precision of the meterstick I used? Explain how you know this based on the data I provided. . The ruler I used was precise to the millimeter so I measured to the nearest tenth of a millimeter. I know that the precision of the ruler that I used was to the millimeter because there are 10 equidistant ticks between centimeters and one tenth of a centimeter is a millimeter. . 3. Create a data table. Make sure you give it a title and make sure you label each column. Include the units you will use. Include a column with calculated values that will “linearize” your graph. . Disk Number Height (cm) Radius (cm) Mass (g)   Radius^2 (cm) . 1 | 0.003125 cm | 6.70 cm | 0.67 g |   | 44.89 cm | . 2 | 0.003125 cm | 5.10 cm | 0.37 g |   | 26.01 cm | . 3 | 0.003125 cm | 4.00 cm | 0.21 g |   | 16.00 cm | . 4 | 0.003125 cm | 3.10 cm | 0.14 g |   | 9.61 cm | . 5 | 0.003125 cm | 2.35 cm | 0.08 g |   | 5.5225 cm | . 4. Graph #1: Non-linear graph showing the relationship between mass of disks (y axis) and radius of disks (x axis), assuming uniform thickness. Make this graph using your graphing calculator or online calculator and insert the picture of it in your document. Is this a LINEAR or NONLINEAR graph? You can provide a mathematical formula underneath your graph (just get it from the calculator.) . Radius versus Mass . . This is a nonlinear graph, you can see that it is nonlinear because the slope of the line is changing as the x value changes. . In our class, linear graphs provide the best relationships for us. . 5. Graph #2: Linearized graph. Make this second graph using your calculator as well. How will you “linearize” your graph? Apply a line of best fit to your graph. Insert this graph. Again, using your calculator, get a mathematical formula… . Radius^2 Versus Mass . . 6. Below your Graph #2, What is the equation for your line of best fit in the form y = slope · x + intercept? . y=0.014814x -0.008326 . Mass=Rho⋅Pi⋅height⋅Radius^2 . The 5 Analysis Questions were answered on paper: . . Synthesis Questions . 1. In this experiment, if we had used disks with a greater thickness, would the slope of your best fit line have been different? Would your experimental value for density be the same? Explain. . The slope would have increased if the disks had a larger thickness but the experimental density would have been the same. This is because as the height increases, the mass would also increase meaning that the density would be the same. . 2. How would your graph of m versus r2 be different if you had used disks of the same thickness, but made out of steel? Draw a second line on your m versus r2 plot that represents disks made of steel. . The graph would be much steeper as the density of steel is much greater than that of aluminum. The red line represents the line for disks made of steel, I got this by dividing the slope of the aluminum plates by 2.7 (the density of aluminum) and multiplying it by 7.85 (the density of steel). . . 3. Another group of students has acquired data for the exact same experiment; however, their disks are made of an unknown material that they are trying to determine. The group’s m versus r2 data produced a line of best fit with slope equal to 122 kg/m2. Each disk they measured had the same 0.5 cm thickness. Calculate the density of the unknown material and use the table below to help determine what material their disks are made of. . Mass=Rho⋅Pi⋅height⋅Radius^2 Slope is rho pi and height, divide slope by height and pi to find rho which is density. 122kg/m^2=0.122g/m^2=12.2g/cm^2 12.2g/cm^2/0.5pi=7.77 so the material is iron. . . .",

Lists and Dictionaries . As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week. Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary.

Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. .

As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure.

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
