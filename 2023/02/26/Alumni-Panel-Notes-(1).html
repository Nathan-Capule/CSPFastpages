  <p>My Takeaway:</p>

  <p>AP Computer Science is such an important class that can and will be seen in everyday life. I like how Collin was able to go into detail about how mechanical engineering and how his background with computer science helps him ease the load and stress of school. I think that my biggest takeaway from this meeting is that APCSP is an important class and I have gained such a greater appreciation for what I am, and what I will learn in this class.</p>

  <p>Insights: I have learned that internships are very important in gaining connections and APCSP is helpful for the rest of your life. I have learned from these past students and experiences that they greatly value their time in Mr.Mortensen’s class and I look forward to learning more.</p>
