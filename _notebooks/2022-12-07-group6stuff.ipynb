    "### 3.9.1\n",
    "* Algorithms can be written in different ways yet still work in teh same way.\n",
    "* The flaw on the second code is that there is no \"or equal to\" sign for 70 so if someone has a grade of 70, nothing would print.\n",
    "* When two algorithms look similar, it does not mean that they do the same exact thing\n",
    "* Notes can help your future self to search for any bugs\n",
    "### 3.9.2\n",
    "* When creating an algorithm, it is good to outline the process before coding.\n",
    "* Represent the code with a flowchart to help planning which makes the coding process more efficient.\n",
    "* Selection chooses from different options\n",
    "### 3.9.3\n",
    "* It is important to use pre-existing algorithms as it can oftentimes make your life easier\n",
    "### 3.11\n",
    "* Binary search divides a search interval in half\n",
    "* Binary search needs to put the numbers in order\n",
    "* Then it needs to find the middle number\n",
    "* Lists can be made with strings\n",
