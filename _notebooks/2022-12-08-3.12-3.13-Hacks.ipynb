    "* A procedure is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and after the code is run, return values.\n",
    "* Parameters are used inside of procedures as independent variables.\n",
    "Parameters can be used in 3 ways, those being sequences, selections, and iterations.\n",
    "* You can call a procedure by writing the name of a procedure and adding the parameters in parentheses.\n",
    "* To return values you must write return followed by the expression.\n",
    "* Arguments are what is printed\n",
    "* Return is necessary for functions to work.\n",

    "* Modularity: Breaking complex programs into easier parts\n",
    "* Abstraction: Hides parts and exposes what is necessary\n",
    "* Duplication: Multiple codes of the same thing, reduces efficacy as it can be simplified.\n",
    "* Steps that a computer follows\n",
    "* Procedure name is the name given to a function or procedure.\n",
    "* Arguments provide information to a function, kind of like a what to do.\n",
