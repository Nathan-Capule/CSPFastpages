<h2 id="what-i-have-learned">What I Have Learned</h2>
<p>This was actually very useful for me actually. I am currently a junior and I am not yet sure what major I want, but from listening to Beveridge and Prter today I think that I have a better grasp of the direction that I should head in. I want to do something hands on yet still implementing code so something in engineering with a more electronic side would be perfect for me. Seeing how Beveridge completed a full 180 on how she wants to live her life has helped me to realize that choosing a major in college is not an end all be all for life. Today was interesting.</p>
